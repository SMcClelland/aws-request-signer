aws-request-signer
===

Helper to evaluate the signing headers for HTTP requests to Amazon Web Services. This is a Scala port of the Java [aws-signing-request-interceptor](https://github.com/inreachventures/aws-signing-request-interceptor).

I originally needed this library to support AWS' [Elasticsearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/), but this library is 'AWS service agnostic'.
